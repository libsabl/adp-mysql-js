# @sabl/adp-mysql
## Adapter pattern for MySQL databases

**adapter** is a pattern for structuring basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for storage of [records](https://github.com/libsabl/patterns/blob/main/patterns/record.md). The adapter pattern itself is agnostic of data source type, and interfaces describing a repository are defined by authors in their own code. 

This library includes reusable mechanics for implementing an adapter-patterned repository that uses a MySQL relational database as its underlying storage.

<!--
